- Setup access to Github for CodePipeline, and generate a personal access token
- Acknowledge stack actions on IAM resources by asserting [`capabilities`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#using-iam-capabilities)
- Review the service role required for CodePipeline
- Review the service role used by CloudFormation when provisioning the stack, and understand how CloudFormation uses privileges, whether supplied by the user or via service role 
- Caution! Remember to delete the stack provisioned by the pipeline, before deleting the pipeline 
- Using a [`DeletionPolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html) with resources 
- Also comment upon explicit dependencies between resources using `DependsOn`
- Use fine-grained privileges when granting access
- On the time taken to provision and de-provision stacks
